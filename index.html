  <h1>My Name is Vasya. I'm 26.</h1>

  <p>I live in Poland, work in construction, and I’m trying to rebuild my life from debt and from scratch. I have a wife, two kids — and just found out we’re expecting a third, a boy. His name will be Sergey. This is my motivation. Pure and real.</p>

  <p>My past? It was hell. Three years of drug addiction. Numb. Hollow. Dead inside. I didn’t go through rehab. No medication. One day — something just clicked. My wife was about to leave. That broke me. I stood up and said: "Enough." Since then — one year clean.</p>

  <p>I’m now rebuilding myself, my family, my path. I had no role model — but I know who I don’t want to be.</p>

  <p>I live by two unbroken rules:
    <ul>
      <li>I never cheat or abandon the ones I love. Loyalty is law.</li>
      <li>I never betray people for money. Ever.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>I can lie to the system — the government — because I believe it’s absurd. Humans are the only creatures who pay to be born, to live, and to die. I believe in another world — one of purpose, where people set the order.</p>

  <p>That’s why I created my brand — <strong>Grit + Legacy</strong>. It’s about turning pain into strength. About discipline. Growth. It’s streetwear with a soul. For those like me — who didn’t give up. Who stood up with no one around. And I know — there are many like me. They just don’t see it yet.</p>

  <p>But that’s just the beginning.</p>

  <p>My main dream is <strong>PartyZan</strong> — a live-action battle zone. Real sweat, real dirt. Not VR. Not screens. Inspired by the word "partisan" — defenders of their land, patient and wild. But PartyZan is more than fun — it’s education.</p>

  <p>For addicts who want to get clean. For teenagers and men with no guide. To learn discipline, mindset, teamwork. To protect yourself — not just from enemies, but from weakness. It teaches survival — even in war. It’s not just a game. It’s training for those who want to be strong — physically, mentally, and spiritually.</p>

  <p>I don’t want millions for show-off. But I do want to become the first millionaire in my family. To prove to my relatives — who openly tell me they don’t believe in me — that they were wrong.</p>

  <blockquote>I don’t want to leave just a grave with a name. Let the sharks eat my body at sea — it’ll be more useful. I want people to say: "He was here. And he did something."</blockquote>

  <p>I don’t need a handout. I need a chance. I want to be around the ones who do. Learn. Grow. Help. I have heart. I have a mind. I have hands. I won’t quit.</p>

  <p>If this touched something in you — reach out. If not — be honest. I respect that too.</p>

  <p><strong>P.S.</strong> I wrote this letter myself. But I shaped it with the help of ChatGPT — sometimes a man needs a partner to find the core.</p>

  <blockquote>"A man doesn’t need much to start. He needs a chance."</blockquote>
